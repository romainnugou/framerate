# Framerate

That's a movie quiz app using the data of [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

This app uses React, Vite and MUI.

## TheMovieDb API

We use [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to fetch data about movies.
You need to have an API key (it's free) to set up your instance of this app.

Once you have your API key, you need to put it in an .env file like that:

`VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEY`
